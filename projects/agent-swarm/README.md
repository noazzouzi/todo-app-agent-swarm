# Agent Swarm Development - Multi-Agent Collaboration System

**Vision:** Multiple specialized AI agents working together in GitHub repositories to create software projects collaboratively.

## Project Architecture

### Core Agents (MVP)
1. **Project Manager Agent** - Requirements, user stories, project coordination
2. **Architecture Agent** - System design, technical decisions, schemas
3. **Development Agent** - Code implementation, testing, documentation

### GitHub Integration
- Issues for task assignment and tracking
- Pull requests for code review between agents
- Project boards for workflow management
- Conventional commits for clear history
- Automated agent assignment based on expertise

### BMAD Methodology Integration
Each agent follows BMAD principles:
- **Business Analysis** - Understanding requirements and goals
- **Marketing Research** - User needs and market validation  
- **Architecture Design** - Technical planning and system design
- **Development Implementation** - Building and testing solutions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [ ] Agent identity system design
- [ ] GitHub workflow automation
- [ ] Communication protocols between agents
- [ ] Basic project structure

### Phase 2: Proof of Concept
- [ ] Simple project (Todo App) with 3 agents
- [ ] Issue-driven development workflow
- [ ] Automated PR reviews and approvals
- [ ] Agent handoff procedures

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Specialized agent skills and expertise
